# Final Project-World Population Data
 

# Segment #1 deliverables:

## Selected Topic
World Population Data 


### Description of source data

- Dataset: World Population 1960-2018, 2020
  - https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/world-population-19602018?select=pop_worldometer_data.csv
- This dataset includes each countries population, net change, land area, migrants, fertility rate, median age, urban population and world share % as of 2020.
- This dataset includes additional csvs that include more specific data like female population percentage, population above age 65, population below age 14 and population density, all from about 1960-2017.


### Questions we hope to answer:

* What variables in this dataset are predictive of a countries net population change?
* How do these variables relate to each other with regard to population change?
* What are the most important variables in this dataset to the outcome of net population change?

## Chosen Database
